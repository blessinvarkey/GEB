# GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid

## Terminologies

__Recursive Mathematical Function__
- Factorials: n! = n*(n-1!) 

```
def factorial(n):
    if(n>1):
        return n*factorial(n-1)
    else:
        return 1
```
- Godel: Every mathematical system is incomplete. 
- Anything you think you know will have something that is off
- Three key takeaways
    - If there is no Truth, no one logical way of doing things, there can only be consistent or inconsistent (Consistency of your actions will dictate )
    - Knowledge is a probability
    - Counterfactuals (hypotheticals): Judgement calls based on counterfactuals (fake news)
