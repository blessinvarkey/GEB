- The formal system aka 'pq-system' of this chapter 
- The pq-system contains three symbols: p, q, - (hyphen) 
- E.g. --p-q--- is an axiom
- If --p--q turns out to be a theorm, then so will --p----q--
- One string can contain multiple meanings
- This sentence is false
- We map words through symbols

A Penrose tiling is an example of an aperiodic tiling. Here, a tiling is a covering of the plane by non-overlapping polygons or other shapes, and aperiodic means that shifting any tiling with these shapes by any finite distance, without rotation, cannot produce the same tiling. However, despite their lack of translational symmetry, Penrose tilings may have both reflection symmetry and fivefold rotational symmetry. Penrose tilings are named after mathematician and physicist Roger Penrose, who investigated them in the 1970s.
