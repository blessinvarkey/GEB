# Two Part Intervention

## Summary
- Two-Part Invention is actually a reprint of Lewis Carroll's 1895 article in Mind, entitled What the Tortoise Said to Achilles. What the Tortoise said is that there is an infinite regress required to justify the venerable Modus Ponens.

- See the Wikipedia article on the dialogue for an explanation and analysis.

- The dialogue hints at an important philosophical problem, which is whether human thought follows formal rules or notâ€”which, Hofstadter writes, "is the problem of this book". [[1](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/geb/)]
